## Prime Number

A positive integer 𝑝 > 1 is called a prime number if and only if 𝑝 has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. A positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

Algorithm to check whether a positive integer 𝑛 is a prime number.

Algorithm 1: Time complexity 𝑂(𝑛)
```cpp
  bool IsPrime(int n)
  {
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    if (n % i == 0) ++cnt;
    return (cnt == 2);
  }
```
Algorithm 2: Time complexity 𝑂(`sqrt(n)`)
  If 𝑎 is a positive divisor of 𝑛 , then there always exists also a positive divisor of 𝑛, such that `a x b = n` (`b = n / a`)
  Suppose `1 <= a <= b -> a^2 <= a x b <= n -> 1 <= a <= sqrt(n)`
